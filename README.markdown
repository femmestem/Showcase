## What is Showcase?
Showcase is an open-source framework for quickly generating and deploying a portfolio web site to showcase your projects with slideshow image galleries, links to GitHub/BitBucket repositories, and an integrated blog that supports embedded code snippets. It's easy to use, with a collection of rake tasks to simplify development.

It's written in semantic HTML5, and pre-styled with a clean, responsive theme that's readily deployable yet highly customizable. Best of all, it's built on top of Jekyll -- since GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, your site is ready to deploy in minutes, for free.


### Features
Want a portfolio that dynamically creates webpages for every project in its folder? How about showcasing your design projects, code projects, photography projects, etc. in separate portfolios? You'll love Showcase.

1. **Multiple portfolio support** with as many projects per portfolio as you want.
2. **Project page templates with built-in slideshow gallery** that automatically loads images stored in the project's image folder.
3. **Blog integration using Octopress 2.0/Jekyll** plus added features: draft and published post mode, rake commands to publish and unpublish multiple posts at once, and site preview with and without drafts.
4. **Third-party integration is simple** with built-in support for GitHub repositories, Google Analytics, Disqus Comments and social media sharing (Twitter, Facebook, Delicious, Pinboard).
5. **Customizable, with community-driven plugins** built for and by Octopress 2.0 and Jekyll users. See available [plugins](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins).


## Quickstart

**Requires:**

1. Ruby > 1.9.3
2. [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
3. An ExecJS supported JavaScript runtime ([see list](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs))

The Quickstart assumes you have a basic understanding of command line, git, and ruby/bundler. If that sounds daunting, Showcase probably isn't for you.

**Set up Showcase**  
```
$ git clone git://github.com/femmestem/showcase.git Showcase
$ cd Showcase
```

**Install dependencies**  
```
$ gem install bundler
$ rbenv rehash # If you use rbenv, you must rehash to run the bundle command
$ bundle install
```

**Install the default Showcase theme**  
`$ rake install`

## Documentation
Documentation coming soon!

Much of the site, blog, and deployment configurations are covered in the guides and documentation at [Octopress.org](http://octopress.org/docs), since this site is a portfolio-focused expansion of the Octopress 2.0 blogging framework. Additional features are listed below.

Portfolio features are based on Jekyll Collections, an experimental feature introduced in Jekyll 2.0. The `new_portfolio` and `new_project` rake tasks set up this functionality for you. If you want to know how it works, check out [Jekyll Collections](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/).

### Some of the Rake tasks available to you:

**rake -T**  
List tasks with params and truncated descriptions

**rake -D**  
List tasks with params and full descriptions

**rake new_page[filename]**  
Creates a new page at `source/filename/index.markdown` or `source/filename.ext`

- No filename given: defaults to `new-page/index.markdown`
- Given a filename without extension: creates a new page as `filename/index.markdown`
- Given filename with extension: creates a new page as `filename.ext`

**rake new_portfolio[title]**  
Creates a new portfolio folder `source/_portfolio-title/` and portfolio index page with album-cover style list of projects at `source/_portfolio-title/index.html`. Also updates Jekyll Collections* in `_config.yml` and `source/_data/collections.yml`.

- No title given: prompts for a title (otherwise defaults to `_new-portfolio/`)
- Given title: creates `_portfolio-title/`

*By registering the portfolio to Jekyll::Site::Collections, the folder becomes Liquid-accessible, i.e. `{% site.portfolio-title %}` returns an array of Document objects in `_portfolio-title/`, much like working with `site.pages` and `site.posts`

**rake new_project[filename]**  
Creates a new project page at `source/_portfolio-title/filename.markdown` and project-specific image folder at `source/images/project-title/`. Images stored in this folder will be automatically loaded into the project's slideshow gallery.

- No filename given: prompts for a title (otherwise defaults to "new project") and presents a selection menu to choose portfolio
- Given filename: uses filename for project title, presents a selection menu to choose portfolio
- Given _portfolio-title/filename: creates project page at `_portfolio-title/filename.markdown` (if portfolio exists)

**rake new_draft[title]**  
Creates a new post in `source/_drafts/`

Draft posts are ignored when Jekyll builds the site for preview, generate, and deploy tasks. To preview your site with draft posts included, use `rake preview[drafts]`. (Note: posts with `published: false` in the front matter will be ignored by `preview` and `preview[drafts]`)

**rake new_post[title]**  
Creates a new post in `source/_posts/`

Posts are considered published posts, included in Jekyll's site build for preview, generate, and deploy tasks. To omit a post, put `published: false` in the front matter (safest method) or use the `rake unpublish` command to revert the post to draft status in the `source/_drafts/` folder. (Note: posts will be given a _new_ datestamp when published again.)

**rake publish[title]**  
Moves draft post from `source/_drafts/title.markdown` to `source/_posts/yyyy-mm-dd-title.markdown`, updates datestamp in front matter `date:` variable, and removes `published: false` variable from front matter (if present).

- No title given: presents a selection menu of draft titles to choose from (allows multiple selections)
- Given title: publishes post if exact match is found, otherwise presents a selection menu of similar draft titles to choose from (allows multiple selections)

**rake unpublish[title]**  
Moves post from `source/_posts/yyyy-mm-dd-title.markdown` to `source/_drafts/title.markdown` and removes the front matter `date:` variable. 

- No title given: presents a menu of post titles to choose from (allows multiple selections)
- Given title: reverts post to draft if exact match is found, otherwise presents a selection menu of similar draft titles to choose from (allows multiple selections)
